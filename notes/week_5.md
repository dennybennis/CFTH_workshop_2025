## Loops

Instruct the computer to repeat conditional statements/tasks.

Code uses true/false answers.

### for loop

```
For (item you would like to iterate over)
    Perform action
```

Ice cream example:
```
for flavour in list:
    if flavour == "vegan chocolate":
        buyIcecream()
    else:
        doNothing()
```

## Functions

Can be called on in the code to complete a certain task.

```
myFunction(variable_only_used_in_function):
    for loop:
        if statement:
            do thing

myFunction(value)
```

## Libraries

You can use pre-written code to complete tasks in Python.

### Natural Language Toolkit

Provides a stopword list.

Tokenization
