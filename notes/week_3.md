## Text wrangling
### CSVs
"Comma separated values"
### Analog coding
Interpreting a text according to a theme

Qualitative process

#### Group activity: analog coding
read excerpt and identify works/phrases relating to gendered work.

##### phrases:

- secretary x3
- married x3
- traditional x1
- retire x1
- babies x1
- husband x2
- family x3
- our level x1
- capable x1
- raising x1
- professional x1
- doing this x1
- do something else x1
- career x1

### Programming

Like writing an essay.

Code should be clear and concise and well-document/annotated.

#### Python

"High level" language: closer to the language you naturally speak (vs the language your computer speaks).

"Low level" includes languages like C.

Easier to "debug" the code thanks to clear error messages.

Processes data relatively quickly.

Automates some functions which can impact efficiency/speed. Will be seen when analyzing very large data sets. Cost of being programmer friendly vs machine friendly.

#### Jupyter Notebook

Environment in which we will write Python.

Can run individual chunks of code.

Keeps projects in steps of coding in one place rather than in individual files.

Allows commentary to be added to code via Markdwn which helps your work be reproducible. Other people will be able to confirm your results. Increases transparency. Many publications are now asking for DH projects to include the code.

#### Why not use Voyant/etc?

Transparency: you don't see the code, only the results. Writing the code yourself allows you to see how conclusions are come to.

### git clone

```git clone [repository https link]```

clone a given repository.
